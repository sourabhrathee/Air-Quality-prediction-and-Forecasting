# Air-Quality-prediction-and-Forecasting
Air pollution remains a pressing environmental
and public health challenge in many countries,
due to emission of particulate matter (i.e.,
PM10 and PM2.5) with urban centers grappling
with hazardous levels of these matters. In this
project, we developed and fine-tuned predictive
ANN algorithms like LSTM, CNN and Ensemble
models to estimate the levels of these fine
particles. We put these algorithms to the test
against data collected from 40 distinct air quality
monitoring stations of India, which, despite their
varied reporting standards and timelines, provide
a rich historical record of over 300,000 hourly
observations from 2010 to 2023. Our results show
that these models are quite adept at forecasting
particulate matter concentrations, with the LSTM
offering a marginally improved performance over
Ensemble models.
